#ReactJS Course Notes (1)

React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. It makes complex web applications:

- less time-consuming to build
- easier to maintain
- more performant

######SPAs (Single Page Applications)

When we talk about Javascript "apps" we're usually talking about SPAs. An SPA website usually loads once, and after that manages all links and form submissions with Javascript through AJAX requests in the background. Changes to the page, and even URL address updates, are handled by Javascript as well.
